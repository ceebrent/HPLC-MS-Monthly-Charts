# Precision

Opens a directory selecting dialogue, 5 text files that end in 1-5 must be placed into this directory.  Each number at the end of a file denotes a seperate day.
Low QC and HIgh QC will be compared in these data sets, it is preferable to have these names as constants in the text file data.
All of the text files will be parsed, sorted and combined into an excel file.  The excel file will be formatted and have many calculations within it.  There are no macros associated with the excel file, just values.
