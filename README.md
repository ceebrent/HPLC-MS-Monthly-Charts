Opens directory selecting window, requires two or more text files from mass specs to compare.  The fields that are being compared are denoted as the 'Inst.' column in the raw text data.
All patients that you wish to compare must be marked as sample type: Unknown and must end in a number, preferably ascending.
An excel file will be generated with all of the comparison values in each field as well as a summary csv that will show all values that are above 25% or are considered as mismatch.
